## What we'll do ##

We will manufacture and distribute safe, FDA approved medication that was discontinued for financial reasons to patients who need it.

Thousands of people live with chronic disease forcing them to take medications for the rest of their life and have no access to them.  While producing these medications might not make financial sense for a pharmaceutical conglomerate we think it's not only profitable, but it's and morally fulfilling.


## What we need ##

We need to answer many questions, so we'll do research and quick prototyping to refine all the hows:

- Should we target patients or doctors?

- Should we outsource production to a small lab and just ensure quality?

- Where should we launch?

- Will insurance companies be a barrier for adoption?


## Where we'll start ##

We've drafted a prototype around crowd funding. People would pledge towards a batch of, for example, Sjögren syndrome medication, and if the goal is met then we produce it and deliver it.

This allow us to know our demand beforehand and to sell entire batches. Since we'll target chronic deceases we could continue production for these patients indefinitely. From there on, we'll continue building our business model.

## Our inspiration ##

Al Roth, the Nobel laureate and Stanford professor of economics built a _Kidney Exchange_ back in 2003 where people in need of kidney transplant could be matched to kidney donors. In the same way we want to **match patients with the correct medication** and help them improve their quality of life.

Perfectly safe and useful medication stops being produced each year because there are not enough financial incentives for _big pharma_ to keep producing them. Many of these are intended to treat chronic diseases and people are left adrift with no alternatives.

As company outside of the value chain and not incentivized to discontinue products in favor of higher-margin, newer drugs we want to serve these people.

## It's close to our heart ##

Our CEO's family has gone through this ordeal in the past and he would like to take this opportunity to talk about it.

> My mom has Sjögren syndrome. It's a really ugly disease that targets mucous glands in the body (eyes, mouth, organs and tissues) and dries them out. It has really ugly symptoms and heavily impacts a person's wellbeing and quality of life. It's a chronic disease so it requires lifetime medication.

> She went undiagnosed for many painful years,  it occurs in 0.1 to 4 percent of the population and although not rare it is not a common disease. When she was finally diagnosed and began treatment her quality of life improved dramatically, and by extension the quality of life of the whole family improved, but a couple years into the treatment her medication was discontinued. We checked with her doctor, the distributor and the lab, worried that the medicine had been pulled for safety reasons, and we learned that production was being stopped for financial reasons, not enough people have Sjögren syndrome so they were switching production to more profitable medications. We were shocked to learn that production wasn't stopped for safety reasons or health related risks, it was a financially motivated decision.

>Looking into alternative treatments, her doctor found a brand of eye drops that contains the same active ingredient, so my mom's symptoms remain under control. It's ridiculous to me that my mom has to drink eye drops to treat her condition instead of having her pills. We all worry sick that the eye drops will get discontinued or the company who imports the drops stops carrying them and the nightmare will begin all over again.

> I've come across other instances of this phenomenon and I have experienced the fear and helplessness that comes from knowing what ails you but not being able to access the solution. I would like to help people with similar experiences to feel safe and have peace of mind, knowing that their medication will always be available for them.
